    <h1>i'm ferit.</h1>
    <p>I am Ferit Yiğit BALABAN, Computer Engineering undergradute (currently in second grade) and a software engineer candidate.</p>
    <h1>growing up</h1>
    <p>I was in my four's when I was introduced to computers, and after two years of pondering around Windows Vista, I met the Internet. Oh, boy. From Flash games to the vast knowledge in Wikipedia, I was an explorer who've just dug out a small piece of an ancient city. Somewhere between my 10's to 12's, all this interest of anything and everything in the internet gradually shifted to the machine that brought what I ordered from it.</p>
    <h1>hello world.</h1>
    <p>Just dreaming and fantasizing about computers, and electricity of course, wasn't enough for me. That was the point which I came across programming. I was quickly interested in electronics and Arduinos! As a beginner, I was fluent in Scratch (lol) until I discovered C++, gave it a shot and got frustrated.</p>
    <h1>microsoft, &lt3 => &lt/3</h1>
    <p>From 2019 to 2022, I developed many Windows desktop applications using C# with WinForms. Late in 2021, I started using Ubuntu (an <a href="tribute.html">GNU+Linux</a> distro) which led me to experiment with the idea of cross-platform applications. Currently, I'm on an Arch Linux machine, with i3-gaps, polybar and kitty!</p>
    <p>I do, and will do my part to support the “Free as in Freedom„ philosopy, and the community of Free and Open Source Software.</p>
    <h1>in conclusion.</h1>
    <p>I'm interested in web design and frontend development; machine learning, especially natural language processing; systems development and operating systems; mathematics. In addition to all those stuff that we can't touch with our fingers, I have a strong affection to electronics, processor design and logic circuits.</p>
    <h1>closing note</h1>
    <p>I love static webpages with their own personalities and worlds, which was the main inspiration for this site! I am not a designer, (one day, hopefully, I will remove this line) but I gave up my sleep for a couple of weeks to come up with what you're seeing right now! That's why your comments are so important.</p>
